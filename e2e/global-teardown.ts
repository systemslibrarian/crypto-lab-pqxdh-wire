/**
 * The runtime half of the coverage rule (lane decision D6).
 *
 * e2e/verdict-coverage.spec.ts asks whether every rendered marker has a
 * recorded mutation. This asks the other question: whether the assertion each
 * mutation record NAMES as its kill actually ran. The answer is read from what
 * `expectVerdict` / `expectClaim` executed, never from the spec's source text —
 * a mention is not an assertion, and the three ways auditors defeated the
 * source scan are all mentions:
 *
 *   - the call commented out: the substring survives, the call does not, and
 *     the (test, marker) pair is never observed;
 *   - the killing assertion rewritten while an unrelated call elsewhere in the
 *     file keeps the id present: a different pair is observed, or the same pair
 *     with a different claim, and neither matches the record;
 *   - the call kept but fed values read off the page in the same test: on the
 *     unmutated baseline that is byte-identical to a correct assertion and no
 *     runtime rule can separate the two — so the record pins the CLAIM as well
 *     as the pair, and the moment the page moves under the mutation the
 *     tautological argument moves with it and stops matching what was recorded.
 *     That is the state the escape existed to survive.
 *
 * It runs here rather than in a project with `dependencies:` deliberately: a
 * dependent project is SKIPPED when the project it needs fails, which is
 * exactly the run — a mutation applied — where this answer matters most.
